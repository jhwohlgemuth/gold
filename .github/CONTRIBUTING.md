## Project Standards
- Code changes should never <sup>[1](#1)</sup> introduce issues detected by `make lint` or `make check`
- When in doubt, write code consistent with preponderance of existing codebase. Let's call this the "***priority of pre-existing preponderance (P3) rule***".
- Exceptions to any of these standards should be supported by strong reasoning and sufficient effort

## *Footnotes*

## [1]
> "Never" is strong language. Sometimes you might need to accept an issue or skip/ignore it. **BUT**, you should always have a good reason for doing so and such scenarios should be few and far between.
